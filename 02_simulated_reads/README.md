### Analysis of removed reads in the preprocessing step of the pipeline 
Artificial samples containing rDNA and rDNA-like reads were generated and fed to the pipeline. In this step, we analyze the removal of the rDNA-like reads. The copy number per sample, coverage, and fraction of removed reads in each step of the piepline.
**Folders**:
- scripts: Rscripts plotting the distribution of removed reads per step, coverage and copy number.
- IMAGES: containing the output images.
